# Setup
1. This repo uses Tailwind CSS for styling. If you have not used Tailwind before, check out their documentation starting at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first.

1. In order to work on this project, you will need to make sure you have Node installed. Once you have done this, move to the root directory for the project and run the command ```npm run build-css```. This will start TailwindCSS and automatically recompile the CSS every time a change is made to the CSS.

### Tailwind CSS Tips
- If you have not already, make sure you add the "Tailwind CSS Intellisense" plugin to VSCode (or your editor of choice). This will help with auto-completion of utility classes when you are trying to add styling.

- To add custom CSS to Tailwind, add CSS rules to the file at ```./src/input.css```. Do not manually add CSS to ```./dist/css/style.css```.

# Contributing
